# Hierarachical clustering
This is a working repository focused on the problem of generating ontological hierarchies from raw corpus text data using various methods. The methods, their usage and further description is in their corresponding folders:

## ontology_hierarchy -> sentence dependency parsing
This folder contains the algorithm of generating ontological hierarchies based on relation extraction using sentence dependency tree parsing and a simple hierarchy construction algorithm.

## hierarchical_clustering
The hierarchical clustering algorithm provides the most relevant centers of a list of vectors in n-dimensional space in a hierarchical fashion. For the application of ontology hierarchies it requires word embeddings.

## Bible_NLP
Simple NLP on the Bible and experimentation of using BERT. TODO: clean-up!
