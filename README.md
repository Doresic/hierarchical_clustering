# Hierarachical clustering
This is a working repository focused on the problem of generating concept hierarchies from raw corpus text data using various methods. The methods, their usage and further description is in their corresponding folders:

## concept_hierarchies -> sentence dependency parsing
This folder contains a method of generating concept hierarchies based on relation extraction using sentence dependency tree parsing and a simple hierarchy construction algorithm.

## old_work
The hierarchical clustering algorithm provides the most relevant centers of a list of vectors in n-dimensional space in a hierarchical fashion. For the application of ontology hierarchies it requires word embeddings. Additionally, some simple NLP done on the Bible and experimentation with BERT.

## data
Data used in these analyses, two corpuses: the KJV Bible and the Theology Reconsidered corpus.
